# ClimateBox

## Short Summary
This project called ClimateBox was created for an educational purpose.

Climate Box can be used to optimize your room. It uses 3 sensors (Temperature and Humidity, Gas and Light) which are used to control a color on a led ring. The possible outcomes on the ledring are: Red, Orange and Green. Red will be triggered if the room is a total mess when it comes to the parameters measured in that room.

A website is provided (hosted on the raspberry pi) which will allow you to look at the history of the sensors. Here you will also be able to control the color on the led ring on the control me page.

If you would like to create this. Please make sure to look up my instructables: https://www.instructables.com/Climate-Box/
